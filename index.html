  <h2> Info </h2>
	<p> Bullet for My Valentine, often abbreviated as BFMV, are a Welsh heavy metal band from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgend" target="_blank">Bridgend, Wales</a>,
    formed in 1998. The band is currently composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar),
    Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Jason Bowld (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar).
    Former members include Michael Thomas, Jason James and Nick Crandle; the latter were on bass.
    They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering
    songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released;
    two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. A change
    of style from Jeff Killed John's style, led the band to change their name. In 2002, the band
    secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced
    by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene.

    Bullet for My Valentine's debut album The Poison was released on 3 October 2005 in the United Kingdom and on
    14 February 2006 in the United States to coincide with Valentine's Day, in a nod to the band's name. The album
    entered the U.S. Billboard 200 at number 128. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of
    America. The band made appearances at the Download Festival and Kerrang! XXV, and undertook a U.S. tour
    with Rob Zombie. Bullet for My Valentine's second studio album, Scream Aim Fire, was released on 29 January
    2008 and debuted at number four on the Billboard 200. The band's third album, Fever, was released on 26
    April 2010 and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200. On 8 February 2013 the band released their
    fourth studio album, Temper Temper, which peaked at number 13 on the Billboard 200. On 14 August 2015 the
    band released their fifth studio album, Venom, which peaked at number 8 on the Billboard 200. On 29 June
    2018 the band released their sixth studio album, Gravity. The band has sold over one million albums in the
    United States and over 4,000,000 albums worldwide and are the most-successful act in the Kerrang! Awards
    category of "Best British Band" with three wins. </p>
	<h3> Musical style and influences </h3>
	<p> Bullet for My Valentine has been described as metalcore, heavy metal, thrash metal, hard rock, emo, screamo, alternative metal,
    and post-hardcore. According to Decibel, Bullet for My Valentine's music consists of " 'heavy metal' leads" and " 'post-hardcore'
    vocals". According to AllMusic, Bullet for My Valentine blend "muscular riffs and emo harmonies" and also "take cues from '80s metal
    bands and punk-infused metal to make melodic, metallic, dark rock songs." The band describe two of    their albums, The Poison and
    Fever, as having a "super dark" tone.
    Bullet for My Valentine member Matt Tuck said, "…we're a hard rock band with metal influences, and I’ve said that from day one." Kirk
    Miller of Decibel praised the band for the effort in synchronised song structures. When asked of their views on their looks, members
    of the band have stated that they would not change their sound or image for a commercial approach; Tuck also said, "Without sounding
    harsh, we're more interested in what our music sounds like than what our fucking hair looks like." Matt Tuck told Exclaim! : "A lot
    of people already think we?'re more of an emo band just because of the name of the band. People need to give the music a fair listen
    musically before they decide to judge it. I say we'?re a melodic metal band, really. That?'s how I?'d describe us." Tuck said he
    prefers people call Bullet for My Valentine a heavy metal band instead of categorizing the band under specific subgenres. In an
    interview with Robert Gray from Ultimate-Guitar.com on 15 April 2010, Tuck said that when making the album Scream Aim Fire,
    Bullet for My Valentine were bothered by critics and journalists who criticized the band and said the band aren't "real metal"
    . Tuck said that the band tried to please people like critics and journalists with Scream Aim Fire. Tuck said: "Scream Aim Fire
    was an album we wrote to try to prove people wrong, and wasn't an album we made for ourselves. Fever is an album that was a
    hundred percent us; we didn't listen to anyone's opinions, what critics' opinions were, or what people thought we should do,
    or how we should sound." Tuck also said about Scream Aim Fire: "Some of it was written a hundred percent for us, but we tried
    a little bit too hard to be metal when we should've just carried on doing what we did really - like we did on all of The
    Poison material." When Tuck was asked if he defines Bullet for My Valentine as a heavy metal band or a hard rock band.
    Bullet for My Valentine's influences include Judas Priest, Def Leppard, Motley Crue, Pantera, Iron Maiden, Metallica,
    Testament, Stuck Mojo, Megadeth, Slayer, Machine Head, Sepultura, Nirvana, Guns N' Roses, Queen, Led Zeppelin, and
    Dire Straits. According to Michael Thomas, these are the bands that inspire Bullet for My Valentine's "catchy vocals,
    aggressive riffs and melodies," Matt Tuck has stated in an interview, his songwriting is highly influenced by Bruce
    Springsteen, Bob Seger and Bob Dylan. He goes on to say that "these bands just are proper old school songwriters." </p>
